HTTPRequests
------------------

This is an attempt at building yet another http library for educational purposes. Any critiques or comments are welcome. I'm using [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html) as the primary guide for this code, and testing it against popular web services (google, amazon, facebook, etc.)
